0.1.0: BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE*
 - *`relative` is no longer available.  Use `relativeFromFile`
   for the same behavior.  The change distinguishes the named
   behavior from `relativeFromDirectory`.  `relative` may
   be reintroduced in a future version, but it will perform a
   `stat` on the path first and branch to either of the
   explicit forms, bearing in mind that performance penalty.
 - *NPM no longer supports packaged submodules.  Access
   `Mock` and `Root` from `"q-fs"` instead of the `Fs` exports
   of `"q-fs/*"`.
 - Added `remove`, `statLink`, `statFd`, `link`, `chown`,
   `chmod`, `append`, `listDirectoryTree`, `makeTree`,
   `removeTree`.
 - Added `toObject(path_opt, charset_opt)` for reading a
   file system into an in-memory object.
 - Added `mock(fs, path)`, and `merge(fss)` for reading
   file systems into a read-only mock, and for merging
   file system layer objects into a single file system,
   like a tar copy.

0.0.16:
 - Fixed a minor bug in distinguishing directories from
   other files in mocked file systems.
 - Generalized the mock.reroot method so that it can be used
   on any file system object.
 - Fixed a bug in contains that applied when the source
   directory was the root directory.
 - Improved handling of the root directory in mock
   file-systems.

0.0.15
 - Added "q-fs/root" for creating an attenuated file system
   API object for a subdirectory of another file system API
   object
 - Added relativeFromDirectory and relativeFromFile to distinguish
   the two cases explicitly.  relative is depre
